# Diabetics-Prediction-Webpage

Diabetes is a chronic medical condition affecting millions worldwide, requiring early detection and management to prevent complications. This project leverages Machine Learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression, to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various medical parameters.

The project is built using Django as the backend framework, providing a robust and scalable environment for web applications. HTML and CSS are used to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. The web application allows users to input health metrics such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and more. The system processes these inputs using the trained machine learning model and returns a prediction on whether the individual is at risk of diabetes.

This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in healthcare, enabling early detection and better management of diabetes. It showcases the integration of machine learning models with web technologies, providing an interactive and informative tool for users.
